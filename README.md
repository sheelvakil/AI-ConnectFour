# AI-ConnectFour

Followed object-oriented programming to create the regular ConnectFour game. 
The game was initially Player vs. Player and then changed it to AI vs. Player by implementing an AI using a modified minimax algorithm. 
The difficulty of the AI can be either changed by changing the depth parameter in the minimax function or changing how the board score is determined.
